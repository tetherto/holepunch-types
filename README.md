# holepunch-types 🛠️

> **Unofficial TypeScript type definitions for the Holepunch ecosystem**

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Welcome! This package provides TypeScript type definitions for key modules in the [Holepunch](https://holepunch.to) ecosystem, making it easier for TypeScript developers to build on top of these amazing peer-to-peer tools.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install holepunch-types
# or
yarn add holepunch-types
# or
bun add holepunch-types
```

## 🚀 Usage

Once installed, the type definitions will be automatically available when you import the corresponding modules:

```typescript
import Autobase from "autobase";
import Hyperswarm from "hyperswarm";
import BlindPairing from "blind-pairing";
import ReadyResource from "ready-resource";
import Corestore from "corestore";
import Hyperbee from "hyperbee";
import Hyperblobs from "hyperblobs";
import Hyperdrive from "hyperdrive";
import * as b4a from "b4a";
import { encode, decode } from "z32";

// TypeScript will now provide full type support for these modules
```

## 🍐 Using with Pear

Get started quickly with TypeScript support in your Pear project:

### 1. Initialize a new Pear project

```bash
pear init --yes --type terminal
```

### 2. Convert to TypeScript

```bash
mv index.js index.ts
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 4. Add type definitions

```bash
bun add github:Drache93/holepunch-types#v0.1.9
```

### 5. Configure TypeScript

Create or update your `tsconfig.json` to include the type definitions:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./node_modules/holepunch-types"]
  }
}
```

### 6. You now have full TypeScript support! 🎉

### 7. Example: Build a P2P chat app

Install some of the supported libraries and start building:

```bash
bun add hyperswarm hyperbee
```

```typescript
// index.ts
import Hyperswarm from "hyperswarm";
import Hyperbee from "hyperbee";
import * as b4a from "b4a";

// Full TypeScript support with autocomplete!
const swarm = new Hyperswarm({
  keyPair: crypto.keyPair(), // Properly typed
  maxPeers: 10,
});

const bee = new Hyperbee(core, {
  keyEncoding: "utf-8",
  valueEncoding: "utf-8",
});

swarm.on("connection", (connection, peerInfo) => {
  // Both connection and peerInfo are fully typed
  console.log("Connected to peer:", b4a.toString(peerInfo.publicKey, "hex"));
});

await swarm.join(b4a.from("chat-room", "utf-8"));
```

### 8. Build and run your app

Build your TypeScript project:

```bash
bun build index.ts --outdir . --packages=external
```

Then run it like a normal(TM) Pear app!:

```bash
pear run -d .
```

### 9. Easy development workflow

Update your `package.json` dev script for easy development:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun build index.ts --outdir . --packages=external && pear run -d ."
  }
}
```

Then simply run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## 📦 Modules Covered
